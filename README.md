# RapidMiner Decision Tree Transducer

## Purpose
Parses the text version of a decision tree generated by RapidMiner. The
decision tree is stored in a Tree object (Tree class is defined in this
file). Tree class implements several output methods so that Tree can be
exported to various visualization libraries.

## Output -- Supported Visualizations
So far the formats expected by the following visualization libraries
are supported:
* ListUI JS Library       http://listui.com/?p=84>
* InfoVis JS Toolkit      http://philogb.github.com/jit/
* d3 JS Vis Library       http://d3js.org/

## Usage

    $ python rmtree.py rmtree.txt 

## About
Script to transform a decision tree produced by RapidMiner (rmtree.txt)
to an HTML table in the format expected by the JS library ListUI.

The decision tree, obviously, has to be in text format. Go to "Text View"
and copy+paste the text of the tree to a file, then pass that file to this
script.

Script stores this decision tree internally as a Tree object. The Tree
class, defined in this file, provides multiple output methods: simple
JSON (which is returned by Tree.__repr__() and Tree.__str__()), and also
a couple of JSON formats expected by popular visualization libaries (see above).

# Classes
* Tree    Simple Tree data structure. call help() for more information.
